## Welcome to the Apivalk documentation

Apivalk is designed to bridge the gap between your API definition and your implementation. It provides a lightweight yet powerful foundation for building high-performance APIs that are automatically documented, strictly validated, and easy to maintain.

## ⚡ What You Can Expect Here

- 📘 **Step-by-Step Guides**: Walkthroughs that take you from initial installation to a production-ready API.
- 🧩 **Practical Examples**: Real-world code snippets showing how to structure controllers, requests, and responses.
- 🔌 **Ecosystem Bridges**: Detailed tutorials for integrating Apivalk into existing Laravel and Symfony applications.
- 🛠️ **Advanced Features**: Deep dives into the middleware pipeline, custom validation, OpenAPI generation, and DX tools.
- 🚀 **Best Practices**: Architectural patterns aligned with SOLID principles and modern PHP standards.

## Why Apivalk?

Apivalk was born from the need to eliminate the "drift" between implementation and documentation. We believe that your code should be the Single Source of Truth, allowing you to focus on building features rather than syncing Swagger files.

- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Your PHP property definitions automatically drive input population, strict validation, and OpenAPI 3.0 export. If it's in the code, it's in the docs.
- **True Type Safety**: We bring strict typing to the HTTP layer, even in PHP 7.2 environments. Your controllers only receive data that has already been validated and cast to the correct types.
- **Zero-Config Automation**: Automated controller discovery and high-performance routing cache mean you spend less time in configuration files and more time writing business logic.
- **Truly Framework-Agnostic**: Apivalk doesn't lock you in. Use it as a standalone microservice framework or as a specialized API layer within your existing Laravel or Symfony projects.
