title: "Route"
description: "The `Route` class is a data carrier that represents a single endpoint in your API. It encapsulates all the necessary information to map a URL and HTTP method to a specific action."
---

## Properties

A `Route` instance contains the following information:

* **URL**: The path template for the endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/{id}`).
* **Method**: An implementation of `MethodInterface` representing the allowed HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc.).
* **Description**: An optional human-readable description used for documentation (OpenAPI).
* **Tags**: A collection of `TagObject` instances used for grouping endpoints in documentation.
* **Security Requirements**: A collection of `SecurityRequirementObject` instances defining the authentication needed for the route.

## Path Parameters

Routes support dynamic path parameters using the `{parameterName}` syntax. For example:

```php
new Route('/users/{id}/profile', new GetMethod());
```

These parameters are automatically identified and converted into capture groups in the internal regex generation logic.

## Integration with Documentation

The `Route` class implements `JsonSerializable`, allowing it to be easily exported for OpenAPI (Swagger) generation. It includes helper methods for:

* `jsonSerialize()`: Converts the route and its metadata into a format suitable for JSON export.
* `static byJson(string $json)`: Hydrates a `Route` object from a JSON string, which is used when loading routes from the router cache.

## Usage in Controllers

In an Apivalk application, you typically don't instantiate `Route` objects manually. Instead, you define them in your controller's static `getRoute()` method:

```php
public static function getRoute(): Route
{
    return new Route(
        '/v1/hello-world',
        new GetMethod(),
        'A simple hello world endpoint',
        [new TagObject('Greeting', 'Endpoints for saying hello')]
    );
}
```

The framework's automated discovery system then picks up these definitions and registers them with the router.
