# Versioning and resource structure

## API versioning strategy

Use URL-based versioning.

Examples:

- https://api.example.com/v1/...
- https://app.example.com/v1/...

Why:

- Explicit versioning in every request
- Easier debugging, monitoring, and routing
- Cleaner folder structure
- Old versions can coexist safely

## Resource structure and folder organization

Use RESTful, hierarchical naming to reflect relationships.

Example:

```http
GET /users/{user_uuid}/addresses
```

Guidelines:

- Plural nouns only (/users, /addresses)
- Keep nesting shallow (2 levels max)
- Actions are defined by HTTP verbs, not URLs
