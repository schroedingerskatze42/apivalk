# Localization and internationalization

## Localization and internationalization (i18n)

All REST APIs should support localized, human-readable messages (success, error, validation). Localization applies only to message strings, never to API contracts or machine-readable fields.
If you do not want to be as dynamic, at least make sure to include English readable messages.

### Request language negotiation

APIs must determine the response language using the standard HTTP request header Accept-Language.

The value must follow BCP 47 language tags (RFC 5646).

Examples:

```http
Accept-Language: de-DE
Accept-Language: de-DE,de;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7
Accept-Language: en
```

### Language resolution rules (mandatory)

Resolve the response language in this order:

1. Accept-Language header
2. Fallback to default language en

If the requested language is not supported, the API must fall back to English and continue processing.

### Response language declaration

Return the resolved language via Content-Language.

```http
Content-Language: de-DE
```

### What must be localized

Localize:

- message fields in success responses
- message fields in error responses
- Validation error messages
- Human-readable descriptions

Must not be localized:

- Field names
- JSON keys
- Error keys or error codes
- Enum values
- IDs, UUIDs, technical identifiers
