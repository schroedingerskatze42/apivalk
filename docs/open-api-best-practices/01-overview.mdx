# REST API Standards Overview

These standards define how REST APIs are designed, documented, and operated within the **Apivalk** ecosystem.

They exist to ensure:

- Consistency across APIs
- Predictable contracts for consumers
- First-class OpenAPI and SDK support
- Long-term maintainability and version safety

> ⚠️ All APIs built with Apivalk **should** comply with these standards.

Benefits:

- Unified documentation (internal and external)
- API-first workflows
- Swagger, Postman, Insomnia, Stoplight compatibility
