# RESTful design and naming

## RESTful design principles

Follow industry-standard REST conventions.

### HTTP methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| GET | Retrieve resources |
| POST | Create a new resource |
| PUT | Fully update an existing resource |
| PATCH | Partially update an existing resource |
| DELETE | Delete a resource |
| OPTIONS | Show available methods (optional if docs cover it) |
| HEAD | Same as GET but returns only headers, no response body |

## Naming conventions

### URI naming

Rules:

- Use plural nouns, lowercase, hyphenated names
- No verbs in URLs
- Nest resources only if there is a logical hierarchy or relationship
- Keep nesting shallow (2 levels max)

Examples:

```http
GET    /users
POST   /users
GET    /users/{user_uuid}
PATCH  /users/{user_uuid}
DELETE /users/{user_uuid}
GET    /users/{user_uuid}/authenticators

GET    /user-groups
GET    /user/{user_uuid}/adress-verification-requests
```

### Resource identifiers: IDs vs UUIDs

Path parameters that identify a single resource should (if possible) use UUIDs.

Rules:

- UUIDs should be used for externally exposed REST APIs
- Numeric, auto-increment IDs (/users/1) must not be exposed; they have a risk for enumeration
- Only when there is no other way around it you can use auto-increment IDs
- Internal IDs may exist but should never be part of the public API contract

Rationale:

- Prevents ID enumeration and scraping
- Improves security by design
- Decouples API contracts from database implementation details
- Enables safer data migrations and sharding

Examples:

Correct:

```http
GET /users/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
PATCH /devices/{device_uuid}
DELETE /orders/{order_uuid}
```

Avoid:

```http
GET /users/1
PATCH /devices/42
```

### Path parameter naming

Path parameters should be explicitly named:

- {user_uuid}
- {order_uuid}
- {device_uuid}

Avoid generic {id} or {uuid} naming to clarify to what resource the ID belongs to.

### Field naming (JSON bodies)

Use snake_case:

```json
{
  "user_name": "john_doe",
  "email_address": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Parameter naming in URI, path, body

Use snake_case consistently:

```http
GET /users?page_size=50&client_id=123
```

```json
{
  "first_name": "Max"
}
```
